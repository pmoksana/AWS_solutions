Objective:
An Amazon CloudWatch Events event calls the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function at 8 PM every day Monday through Saturday.
2	The salesAnalysisReport Lambda function invokes another Lambda function, salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor, to retrieve the report data.
3	The salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor function runs an analytical query against the café database (cafe_db).
4	The query result is returned to the salesAnalysisReport function.
5	The salesAnalysisReport function formats the report into a message and publishes it to the salesAnalysisReportTopic Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.
6	The salesAnalysisReportTopic SNS topic sends the message by email to the administrator.

 Recognized necessary IAM policy permissions to enable a Lambda function to other AWS resources
Created a Lambda layer to satisfy an external library dependency
Created Lambda functions that extract data from database, and send reports to user.
Deployed and tested a Lambda function that is initiated based on a schedule and that invokes another function
Used CloudWatch logs to troubleshoot any issues running a Lambda function


# Task 1: Observing the IAM role settings
In this lab, you create two Lambda functions. Each function requires permissions to access the AWS resources with which they interact. 

In this task, you analyze the IAM roles and the permissions that they grant to the salesAnalysisReport and salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor Lambda functions that you create later.

Task 1.1: Observing the salesAnalysisReport IAM role settings
In the AWS Management Console, choose Services > Security, Identity, & Compliance > IAM.

In the navigation pane, choose Roles.

 

  choose the salesAnalysisReportRole hyperlink.

Choose the Trust relationships tab, and notice that lambda.amazonaws.com is listed as a trusted entity, which means that the Lambda service can use this role.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
Choose the Permissions tab, and notice the four policies assigned to this role. To expand each role and analyze the permissions that each policy grants, choose the + icon next to each role:

AmazonSNSFullAccess provides full access to Amazon SNS resources.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "sns:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}

AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess provides read-only access to Systems Manager resources.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "ssm:Describe*",
                "ssm:Get*",
                "ssm:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}

AWSLambdaBasicRunRole provides write permissions to CloudWatch logs (which are required by every Lambda function).
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}

AWSLambdaRole gives a Lambda function the ability to invoke another Lambda function. 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "lambda:InvokeFunction"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}

The salesAnalysisReport Lambda function that you create later in this lab uses the salesAnalysisReportRole role.

Task 1.2: Observing the salesAnalysisReportDERole IAM role settings
Choose Roles again.

In the search box, enter sales

From the filtered results, choose the salesAnalysisReportDERole hyperlink.

Choose the Trust relationships tab, and notice that lambda.amazonaws.com is listed as a trusted entity.

Choose the Permissions tab, and notice the permissions granted to this role:

AWSLambdaBasicRunRole provides write permissions to CloudWatch logs.
 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
AWSLambdaVPCAccessRunRole provides permissions to manage elastic network interfaces to connect a function to a virtual private cloud (VPC).
 {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents",
                "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
                "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
                "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
The salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor Lambda function that you create next uses the salesAnalysisReportDERole role.

 

Task 2: Creating a Lambda layer and a data extractor Lambda function
In this task, you first create a Lambda layer, and then you create a Lambda function that uses the layer.

Start by downloading two required files.

To download the lab files required by this task to your local machine, choose the following links:

pymysql-v3.zip

salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor-v3.zip

Note: The salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor-v3.zip file is a Python implementation of a Lambda function that makes use of the PyMySQL open-source client library to access the MySQL café database. This library has been packaged into the pymysql-v3.zip which is uploaded to Lambda layer next.

Task 2.1: Creating a Lambda Layer
In the next steps, you create a Lambda layer named pymysqlLibrary and upload the client library into it so that it can be used by any function that requires it. Lambda layers provide a flexible mechanism to reuse code between functions so that the code does not have to be included in each function’s deployment package.

In the AWS Management Console, choose Services > Compute > Lambda.

Tip: If the navigation panel is closed, choose the collapsed menu icon (three horizontal lines) to open the AWS Lambda panel.

Choose Layers.

Choose Create layer.

Configure the following layer settings:

For Name, enter pymysqlLibrary

For Description, enter PyMySQL library modules

Select Upload a .zip file. To upload the pymysql-v3.zip file, choose Upload, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the pymysql-v3.zip file, and open it.

For Compatible runtimes, choose Python 3.9.

Choose Create.

The message "Successfully created layer pymysqlLibrary version 1" is displayed.

Tip: The Lambda layers feature requires that the .zip file containing the code or library conform to a specific folder structure. The pymysqlLibary.zip file used in this lab was packaged using the following folder structure:

Lambda Layer directory structure showing python libraries used by the function .

For more information about layer paths, see Including Library Dependencies in a Layer.

Task 2.2: Creating a data extractor Lambda function
In the navigation pane, choose Functions to open the Functions dashboard page.

Choose Create function, and configure the following options:

At the top of the Create function page, select Author from scratch.

For Function name, enter salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor

For Runtime, choose Python 3.9.

Expand Change default execution role, and configure the following options:    

For Execution role, choose Use an existing role.

For Existing role:, choose salesAnalysisReportDERole.

Choose Create function.

A new page opens with the following message: "Successfully created the function salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor."

Task 2.3: Adding the Lambda layer to the function
In the Function overview panel, choose Layers.

At the bottom of the page, in the Layers panel, choose Add a layer.

On the Add layer page, configure the following options:

Choose a layer: Choose Custom layers.

Custom layers: Choose pymysqlLibrary.

Version: Choose 1.

Choose Add.

The Function overview panel shows a count of (1) in the Layers node for the function.

Task 2.4: Importing the code for the data extractor Lambda function
Go to the Lambda > Functions > salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor page.

In the Runtime settings panel, choose Edit.

For Handler, enter salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor.lambda_handler

Choose Save.

In the Code source panel, choose Upload from.

Choose .zip file.

Choose Upload, and then navigate to and select the salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor-v3.zip file that you downloaded earlier.

Choose Save.

The Lambda function code is imported and displays in the Code source panel. If necessary, in the Environment navigation pane, double-click salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor.py to display the code.
import boto3
import pymysql
import sys

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # Retrieve the database connection information from the event input parameter.

    dbUrl = event['dbUrl']
    dbName = event['dbName']
    dbUser = event['dbUser']
    dbPassword = event['dbPassword']

    # Establish a connection to the Cafe database, and set the cursor to return results as a Python dictionary.

    try:
        conn = pymysql.connect(host=dbUrl, user=dbUser, passwd=dbPassword, db=dbName, cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)

    except pymysql.Error as e:
        print('ERROR: Failed to connect to the Cafe database.')
        print('Error Details: %d %s' % (e.args[0], e.args[1]))
        sys.exit()

    # Execute the query to generate the daily sales analysis result set.

    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT  c.product_group_number, c.product_group_name, a.product_id, b.product_name, CAST(sum(a.quantity) AS int) as quantity FROM order_item a, product b, product_group c WHERE b.id = a.product_id AND c.product_group_number = b.product_group GROUP BY c.product_group_number, a.product_id")
        result = cur.fetchall()

    # Close the connection.

    conn.close()

    # Return the result set.

    return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': result}

Review the Python code that implements the function.

Note: If the code does not yet display in the function code editor, refresh the console so that it displays.

Read the comments included in the code to gain an understanding of its logic flow. Notice that the function expects to receive the database connection information (dbURL, dbName, dbUser, and dbPassword) in the event input parameter.

Task 2.5: Configuring network settings for the function
The final step before you can test the function is to configure its network settings. As the architecture diagram at the start of this lab shows, this function requires network access to the café database, which runs in an EC2 LAMP instance. Therefore, you need to specify the instance’s VPC, subnet, and security group information in the function’s configuration.

Choose the Configuration tab, and then choose VPC.

Choose Edit, and configure the following options:

VPC: Choose the option with Cafe VPC as the Name.

Subnets: Choose the option with Cafe Public Subnet 1 as the Name.

Tip: You can ignore the warning (if any) that recommends choosing at least two subnets to run in high availability mode because it is not applicable to the function.

Security groups: Choose the option with CafeSecurityGroup as the Name.

Notice that the security group’s inbound and outbound rules are automatically displayed following the field.

Choose Save.

 

Task 3: Testing the data extractor Lambda function
Task 3.1: Launching a test of the Lambda function
You are now ready to test the salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor function. To invoke it, you need to supply values for the café database connection parameters. Recall that these are stored in Parameter Store.

On a new browser tab, open the AWS Management Console, and choose Services > Management & Governance > Systems Manager.

In the navigation pane, choose Parameter Store.

Choose each of the following parameter names, and copy and paste the Value of each one into a text editor document:

/cafe/dbUrl

/cafe/dbName

/cafe/dbUser

/cafe/dbPassword

Return to the Lambda Management Console browser tab. On the salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor function page, choose the Test tab.

Configure the Test event panel as follows:

For Test event action, select Create new event.

For Event name, enter SARDETestEvent

For Template, choose hello-world.

In the Event JSON pane, replace the JSON object with the following JSON object:

{
  "dbUrl": "<value of /cafe/dbUrl parameter>",
  "dbName": "<value of /cafe/dbName parameter>",
  "dbUser": "<value of /cafe/dbUser parameter>",
  "dbPassword": "<value of /cafe/dbPassword parameter>"
}
In this code, substitute the value of each parameter with the values that you pasted into a text editor in the previous steps. Enclose these values in quotation marks.

Choose Save.

Choose Test.

After a few moments, the page shows the message "Execution result: failed". 

Task 3.2: Troubleshooting the data extractor Lambda function
In the Execution result pane, choose Details to expand it, and notice that the error object returned a message similar to the following message after the function ran:

{
  "errorMessage": "2019-02-14T04:14:15.282Z ff0c3e8f-1985-44a3-8022-519f883c8412 Task timed out after 3.00 seconds"
}
This message indicates that the function timed out after 3 seconds.

The Log output section includes lines starting with the following keywords:

START indicates that the function started running.

END indicates that the function finished running.

REPORT provides a summary of the performance and resource utilization statistics related to when the function ran.

What caused this error?

Task 3.3: Analyzing and correcting the Lambda function
In this task, you analyze and correct the issue observed when you tested the Lambda function.

Here are a few hints to help you find the solution:

One of the first things that this function does is connect to the MySQL database running in a separate EC2 instance. It waits a certain amount of time to establish a successful connection. After this time passes, if the connection is unsuccessful, the function times out.

By default, a MySQL database uses the MySQL protocol and listens on port number 3306 for client access.
lick the Edit inbound rules button.

Choose Add rule.

For the Type, select MySQL/Aurora. This will automatically fill the Port range with 3306.
For the Source, you need to specify where the connection is coming from.
If you're connecting from your own computer, you can choose My IP.
If you're connecting from the EC2 instance that's part of the lab, you should select the security group ID of that instance as the source.
Choose the Configuration tab again, and choose VPC. Notice the Inbound rules for the security group that are used by the EC2 instance running the database. Is the database port number (3306) listed? You can choose the security group link if you want to edit and add an inbound rule to it.
Once you have corrected the problem, return to browser tab with the salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor function page. Choose the Test tab, and choose Test again.

You should now see a green box showing the message “Execution result: succeeded (logs).” This message indicates that the function ran successfully.

Choose Details to expand it.

The function returned the following JSON object:

{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": []
}
The body field, which contains the report data that the function extracted, is empty because there is no order data in the database.

Task 3.4: Placing an order and testing again
In this task, you access the café website and place some orders to populate data in the database. 

To open the café website on a new browser tab, find the public IP address of the café EC2 instance. 

The URL for the website has the format http://publicIP/cafe where publicIP is the public IP address of the café EC2 instance. There are two ways to find the public IP address:

Option 1: 

On the AWS Management Console, choose Services > Compute > EC2.

In the navigation pane, choose Instances.

Choose CafeInstance.

Copy the Public IPv4 address to a text editor. 

On a new browser tab, enter http://publicIP/cafe, and replace publicIP with the public IPv4 address that you just copied to a text editor.

Press Enter to load the café website.

Option 2:

At the top of these instruction, choose Details, and then choose Show. 

From the Credentials window, copy and paste the CafePublicIP to a text editor.

On a new browser tab, enter http://publicIP/cafe, and replace publicIP with the public IPv4 address that you just copied to a text editor.

Press Enter to load the café website.

On the café website, choose Menu, and place some orders to populate data in the database. 

Now that there is order data in the database, you test the function again. 

Go to the browser tab with the salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor function page.

Choose the Test tab, and choose Test.

The returned JSON object now contains product quantity information in the body field similar to the following:

{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": [
    {
      "product_group_number": 1,
      "product_group_name": "Pastries",
      "product_id": 1,
      "product_name": "Croissant",
      "quantity": 1
    },
    {
      "product_group_number": 2,
      "product_group_name": "Drinks",
      "product_id": 8,
      "product_name": "Hot Chocolate",
      "quantity": 2
     }
    ]
}
Congratulations! You have successfully created the salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor Lambda function.

 

Task 4: Configuring notifications
In this task, you create an SNS topic and then subscribe an email address to the topic.

Task 4.1: Creating an SNS topic
In this task, you create the SNS topic where the sales analysis report is published and subscribe an email address to it. The topic is responsible for delivering any message it receives to all of its subscribers. You use the Amazon SNS console for this task.

On the AWS Management Console, choose Services > Application Integration > Simple Notification Service.

In the navigation pane, choose Topics, and then choose Create topic.

Note: If the Topics link is not visible, choose the three horizontal lines icon, and then choose Topics.

The Create topic page opens.

Configure the following options:

Type: Choose Standard.

Name: Enter salesAnalysisReportTopic

Display name: Enter SARTopic

Choose Create topic.

Copy and paste the ARN value into a text editor document.

You need to specify this ARN when you configure the next Lambda function.

Task 4.2: Subscribing to the SNS topic
Choose Create subscription, and configure the following options:

Protocol: Choose Email.

Endpoint: Enter an email address that you can access.

Choose Create subscription.

The subscription is created and has a Status of Pending confirmation.

Check the inbox for the email address that you provided.

You should see an email from SARTopic with the subject "AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation."

Open the email, and choose Confirm subscription.

A new browser tab opens and displays a page with the message "Subscription confirmed!"

 

Task 5: Creating the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function
Next, you create and configure the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function. This function is the main driver of the sales analysis report flow. It does the following:

Retrieves the database connection information from Parameter Store

Invokes the salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor Lambda function, which retrieves the report data from the database

Formats and publishes a message containing the report data to the SNS topic

Task 5.1: Connecting to the CLI Host instance
In this task, you use EC2 Instance Connect to log in to the CLI Host instance running in your AWS account that already has the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) installed and the the Python code needed to create the next Lambda function. You then then run an AWS CLI command to create the Lambda function. Finally, you unit test the new function using the Lambda management console.

On the EC2 Management Console, in the navigation pane, choose Instances.

From the list of EC2 instances, choose the  check box for the CLI Host instance. 

Choose Connect.

On the EC2 Instance Connect tab, choose Connect to connect to the CLI Host.

Task 5.2: Configuring the AWS CLI
Amazon Linux instances have the AWS CLI pre-installed; however, you still need to supply credentials to connect the AWS CLI client to an AWS account.

In the EC2 Instance Connect terminal window, run the following command to update the AWS CLI software with the credentials:

aws configure
At the prompts, enter the following information:

AWS Access Key ID: At the top of these instructions, choose the Details dropdown menu, and then choose Show. A Credentials window opens. From this window, copy the AccessKey value, paste it into the terminal window, and press Enter.

AWS Secret Access Key: From the same Credentials window, copy the SecretKey value, paste it into the terminal window, and press Enter.

Default region name: Enter the Region code for the Region where you created the previous Lambda function. For this lab, enter the us-west-2 Region code into the terminal window, and press Enter. To find this code, in the upper-right menu of the Lambda management console, choose the Region dropdown menu. 

Default output format: Enter json and press Enter.

Task 5.3: Creating the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function using the AWS CLI
To verify that the salesAnalysisReport-v2.zip file containing the code for the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function is already on the CLI Host, run the following commands in the terminal:

cd activity-files
ls
Note: Before you create the function, you must retrieve the ARN of the salesAnalysisReportRole IAM role. You specify it in the following steps.

To find the ARN of an IAM role, open the IAM management console, and choose Roles. 

In the search box, enter salesAnalysisReportRole, and choose the role name. The Summary page includes the ARN.

Copy and paste the ARN to a text editor document.

Next, you use the Lambda create-function command to create the Lambda function and configure it to use the salesAnalysisReportRole IAM role.

To do this, at the terminal window command prompt, paste the following command. Replace <salesAnalysisReportRoleARN> with the value of the salesAnalysisReportRole ARN that you copied in a previous step, and replace <region> with the us-west-2 Region code. This is the Region where you created the previous Lambda function. To find this code, in the upper-right menu of the Lambda management console, choose the Region dropdown menu.

aws lambda create-function \
--function-name salesAnalysisReport \
--runtime python3.9 \
--zip-file fileb://salesAnalysisReport-v2.zip \
--handler salesAnalysisReport.lambda_handler \
--region <region> \
--role <salesAnalysisReportRoleARN>
Once the command completes, it returns a JSON object describing the attributes of the function. You now complete its configuration and unit test it.

Task 5.4: Configuring the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function
Open the Lambda management console.

Choose Functions, and then choose salesAnalysisReport. 

The Details page for the function opens.

Review the details in the Function overview and Code source panels for the created function.

In particular, read through the function code, and use the embedded comments to help you understand the logic.

Notice on line 26 that the function retrieves the ARN of the topic to publish to, from an environment variable named topicARN. Therefore, you need to define that variable in the Environment variables panel.

Choose the Configuration tab, and choose Environment variables.

Choose Edit.

Choose Add environment variable, and configure the following options:

Key: Enter topicARN

Value: Paste the ARN value of the salesAnalysisReportTopic SNS topic that you copied earlier.

Choose Save.

The following message appears: "Successfully updated the function salesAnalysisReport."

Task 5.5: Testing the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function
You are now ready to test the function.

Choose the Test tab, and configure the test event as follows:

For Test event action, choose Create new event.

For Event name, enter SARTestEvent

For Template, choose hello-world.

The function does not require any input parameters. Leave the default JSON lines as is.

Choose Save.

Choose Test.

A green box with the message “Execution result: succeeded (logs)” appears.

Tip: If you get a timeout error, choose the Test button again. Sometimes, when you first run a function, it takes a little longer to initialize, and the Lambda default timeout value (3 seconds) is exceeded. Usually, you can run the function again, and the error will go away. Alternatively, you can increase the timeout value. To do so, follow these steps:

Choose the Configuration tab.

Choose General configuration.

Choose Edit.

Adjust the Timeout as needed. 

Choose Save.

Choose Details to expand it.

The function should have returned the following JSON object:

{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "\"Sale Analysis Report sent.\""
}
Check your email inbox.

If there were no errors, you should receive an email from AWS Notifications with the subject "Daily Sales Analysis Report."

The email should contain a report that is similar to the following image depending on the orders that you placed on the café website:

Email report that lists the items ordered from the café website.

You can place more orders on the café website and test the function to see the changes in the report that you receive.

Great job! You have successfully unit tested the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function.

Task 5.6: Adding a trigger to the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function
To complete the implementation of the salesAnalysisReport function, configure the report to be initiated Monday through Saturday at 8 PM each day. To do so, use a CloudWatch Events event as the trigger mechanism.

In the Function overview panel, choose Add trigger. The Add trigger panel is displayed.

In the Add trigger panel, configure the following options:

In the Trigger configuration pane, from the dropdown list, choose EventBridge (CloudWatch Events).

For Rule, choose Create a new rule. 

For Rule name, enter salesAnalysisReportDailyTrigger

For Rule description, enter Initiates report generation on a daily basis

For Rule type, choose Schedule expression.

For Schedule expression, specify the schedule that you would like by using a Cron expression. The general syntax of a Cron expression requires six fields separated by spaces as follows: 

cron(Minutes Hours Day-of-month Month Day-of-week Year): In addition, all times in a Cron expression are based on the UTC time zone.

Note: For testing purposes, enter an expression that schedules the trigger 5 minutes from the current time. You can use the following examples:

If you are in London (UTC time zone), and the current time is 11:30 AM, enter the following expression:

cron(35 11 ? * MON-SAT *)

If you are in New York (UTC time zone -5 during Eastern Standard Time), and the current time is 11:30 AM, enter the following expression:

cron(35 16 ? * MON-SAT *)

This Cron expression schedules the event to be invoked at 11:35 AM Monday through Saturday.

Tip: For more information about the syntax of schedule expressions for rules, see Schedule Expressions for Rules.

To get the correct UTC time, navigate to any browser and enter UTC time

Choose Add.

The new trigger is created and displayed in the Function overview panel and Triggers pane.

Consider the following challenge question, and adjust the Cron expression as needed: What should the Cron expression be when you deploy the function in production? Remember that you need to schedule the trigger every day, Monday through Saturday. Assume the you are in the UTC time zone.

Wait until 5 minutes have elapsed, and then check your email inbox.

If there were no errors, you should see a new email from AWS Notifications with a subject of "Daily Sales Analysis Report." The CloudWatch Events event invoked this message at the time that you specified in the Cron expression.
