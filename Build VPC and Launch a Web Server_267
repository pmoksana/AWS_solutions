###Build Your VPC and Launch a Web Server

 Objectives:
Create a virtual private cloud (VPC)
Create subnets
Configure a security group
Launch an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance into a VPC


Case:
1.Create an own VPC and add additional components to produce a customized network for a Fortune 100 customer. 
2.Create security groups for your EC2 instance. 
3.Configure and customize an EC2 instance to run a web server and launch it into the VPC that looks like the following customer diagram

Task 1: Create a VPC an internet gateway, and two subnets in a single Availability Zone.
An internet gateway is a VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
After creating a VPC add subnets. Each subnet resides entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. 
If a subnet's traffic is routed to an internet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet.
If a subnet does not have a route to the internet gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet.
The wizard also creates a NAT gateway, which is used to provide internet connectivity to EC2 instances in private subnets.


=> 1.1.Create VPC and configure the following options:
Resources to create: Choose VPC and more
Name tag auto-generation: UnCheck the box Auto-generate
IPv4 CIDR: Enter 10.0.0.0/16
IPv6 CIDR block: Choose No IPv6 CIDR block.
Tenancy: Choose Default.
Number of Availability Zones (AZs) :  1
Number of public subnets:  1
Number of private subnets:  1
Expand Customize subnets CIDR blocks
Public subnet CIDR block in us-west-2a: 10.0.0.0/24
Private subnet CIDR block in us-west-2a: 10.0.1.0/24
NAT gateways: Choose In 1 AZ
VPC endpoints: Choose None
On the Preview pane, name the resources as follows:
VPC: Lab VPC
Subnets (2)
First box, Public subnet one without name tag: Public Subnet 1
Second box, Private subnet one without name tag: Private Subnet 1
Route tables (2)
First box, Public route table without name tag: Public Route Table
Second box, Private route table without name tag: Private Route Table
Choose Create VPC.

  2.Task 2: Create two additional subnets in a second Availability Zone to provide high availability.

Create subnet and configure the following options:

VPC ID: From the dropdown list, choose Lab VPC.
Subnet name: Enter Public Subnet 2    
Availability Zone: No preference
IPv4 CIDR block: Enter 10.0.2.0/24
Choose Create subnet.

The subnet will have all IP addresses starting with 10.0.2.x.

To configure the second private subnet, choose Create subnet and configure the following options:

VPC ID: From the dropdown list, choose Lab VPC.
Subnet name: Enter Private Subnet 2
Availability Zone: No preference
IPv4 CIDR block: Enter 10.0.3.0/24
Choose Create subnet.

The subnet will have all IP addresses starting with 10.0.3.x.
