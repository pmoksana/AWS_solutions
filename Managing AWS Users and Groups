To validate that users have been created:
enter sudo cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 

[ec2-user]$ sudo cat/etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1

 sudo cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 

[ec2-user]$ sudo cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1

Task 4: Log in using the new users
 
  su arosalez

 password  P@ssword1234!  
You are now logged in as arosalez.

[arosalez@ec2-user]$
 
Ensure that you are in the /home/ec2-user directory.

Enter touch myFile.txt and press Enter.

[arosalez@ec2-user]$ touch myFile.txt
touch: cannot touch ‘myFile.txt’: Permission denied

You receive this message because the user arosalez does not have permission to write files to the ec2-user home folder.


sudo touch myFile.txt and press Enter.
password P@ssword1234!  

[arosalez@ec2-user]$ touch myFile.txt
arosalez is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.

You receive this message because the user arosalez is not on the list of the sudoers file. Sudoers are users who have special rights to run commands that require root rights. Only a few users should receive this permission.

Exit 

Switch to the previous user, ec2-user.

Now you visualize the content of the /var/log/secure file.
sudo cat /var/log/secure 
 
Aug  9 14:45:55 ip-10-0-10-217 sudo: arosalez : user NOT in sudoers ; TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/home/ec2-user ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/touch myFile.txt
You can see how a sudo and not permitted action was logged into the /var/log/secure file
